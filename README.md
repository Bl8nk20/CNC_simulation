# CNC_simulation

## Introduction to this Project

This Project is going to be a successor to  
Hubert Klinker's PalMill & PalTurn Programs.
This is going to be hopefully as usefull for future apprentices as it was for me to learn CNC-Programming.

## Features

This Project should have at least the following features:

* Text-Editor
* Possibilities to save, export and load configurations from CNC-Maschine's
* Adjustment and Configuration of Material and Tools
* Easy to use and understand UI
* Visualisation of programmed CNC Code

The following features are a nice to have features, which are not too esential, but helps enormous in developing

* Syntax-Highlighting
* Debugging features
* Code Completions
